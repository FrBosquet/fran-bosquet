> This was the first post I wrote when I started this blog in 2017. I seem to remember that I didn't really know how to start with the content and I thought of making a first contact post. I have mixed feelings: On the one hand I find this sincericide tremendously repipi.

> But on the other hand, I really like having a record of how I saw things in 2017. Understanding what I was worried about back then gives me perspective on how far I have come and how wonderfully well things have gone.

Good morning/afternoon/evening, my name is Fran Bosquet and I would like to welcome you to my blog.

![I, many years ago](fran-bosquet-2017)

I have created this space with very different intentions. The first is due to the fact that I am immersed in a very particular "journey". Until recently I spent most of my time working as a technician on a construction site. At a certain point, I realised that my job was making me very unhappy and that it was getting worse every day, so I decided to radically change direction and I made a plan to build a new career. A week ago I ended my relationship with the construction company I was working for and, using some of the time I now have, I would like to document my steps from now on to leave a record and, perhaps, help someone who is considering a leap like the one I am taking.

The second of my intentions is to get back to writing. I used to enjoy this activity a lot in a couple of personal blogs that I had in msnSpaces and blogger. Over time, and due to circumstances, I stopped. For some time now I've realised that I'm a lousy writer. That is to say, it's not that my latest novel doesn't sell at all, it's that I find it very difficult to come up with an idea and structure a text from it, I lose conciseness and end up rambling without clearly expressing the concept I wanted. I have the impression that I have lost this skill, which I thought was natural, by not practising it. That is why I would like to take advantage of this space to take up this activity again and be able to transcribe my ideas, projects or opinions clearly and concisely. I am sure that in the future having my fingers and mind trained will be useful to me in one way or another.

Finally, I would like to post here all kinds of opinions, reviews, tutorials, experiences... I often find myself in front of a series, film, book, videogame, website, event, etc. that I would like to comment on, but I feel that social networks are not the right forum. I am also a person with many interests, and I often draw, compose some music, program something... and I would like to have a place to show these things. In the end, more than showing this kind of stories, I would like to have a kind of diary that I can revisit myself and see where I was at a certain moment, but I don't want to stop making the effort to compile, write and make it presentable.

Without further ado, I wish you a happy day.

Best regards!
